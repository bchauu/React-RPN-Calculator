# React-RPN-Calculator

This reverse polish notation calculator can add multiple numbers into a stack.
To add a specific number into a stack, click the space (blank button) on the calculator.
Clicking any of the four signs button will only calculate if there are at least two numbers currently in the stack since RPN is post-fix.
The 'C' button clears of all stack and current computations in the calculator.
